</h1>
                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">Apple Music is a music and video streaming service developed by Apple. Users are able to select music to stream to their device on-demand, download music to their library, or they can listen to existing playlists.
        
                    <p>As a daily user of Apple Music, I was annoyed that I could only share playlists with my friends through my profile and had to use iMessage to share individual songs.</p> 
                        <h3>I wanted to allow users to share songs with their friends without having to use a third party source.</h3>

                    <h1 data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.1s">The Process</h1>

                    </h2>
                        <p>In order to get a better understanding of user needs and complete my redesign, I first placed the features that Apple Music has in a survey and asked users feature they use most frequently.</p> 
                    <img src="assets/img/features%20chart.png" alt="graph">
                    <h3>After gathering basic data from 33 users, I asked 57 Apple Music users what feature needed to be improved the most.</h3>
                    <img src="assets/img/improved%20chart.png" alt="graph">
                    <h3>75.4% of users said that "sharing a song with a friend" was the feature that needed to be improved the most.</h3>

                    <h3 data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">Pain Point     
                    </h3>
                        <p>Based on the information I collected I found that Apple Music does not allow their users to share specific songs with their friends within the app. Once you hit "share" users are directed to send the song through text message, email, etc. which is an inefficient proccess for the users.</p>

                    <h2 data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.1s">Mock up
</h2>
                    <p>Once I decided on an appropriate information archetecture and user flow, I was able to design a visual mockup.</p>
                    
                    <h3> Pain Point: Users can't share specific songs with their friends through the app.</h3>
                    <h4>Solution:</h4>
                        <p>Based on the results of the Google Survey as well as the analysis of UX and usability dimensions of the app, I have came up with the new design implementation for sharing songs with other Apple Music users. In order to fix this issue, I decided to have your friends on Apple Music as the main option to send as opposed to your contacts. This design allows users to feel more connected and have a more ineractive experience.</p>

                   <p>Thank you for reading this case study! In the future, I hope to test my design and I would love to hear any feedback from you contact me by email durki2me@dukes.jmu.edu. This project was created as a part of an App Flow Redesign assignment in SMAD308: Interactive Design II course at James Madison University. This project allowed me to further my understanding of UX and work to create an easy solution for everyday challenges.</p>
